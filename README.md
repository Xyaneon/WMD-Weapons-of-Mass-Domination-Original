# WMD: Weapons of Mass Domination (Original)

The original implementation of the WMD: Weapons of Mass Domination game.

This is one of the first programs I ever wrote that was not for a homework
assignment, written during my time as a junior high school student in the
[Utica Center for Mathematics, Science and Technology (UCMST)][UCMST] program
all the way back in 2006. This was implemented in Borland C++ on Windows XP.

There are two copies of the source code in this repository, each typed back in
from the hard copies I've kept in a folder hidden in my bedroom after all of
this time:
- **[`WMDGAMEV1P6.CPP`][V1P6]:** I think this was the older one, despite its
  hard copy having a later printing date. Only supports single-player.
- **[`WMDgameVM1p0.cpp`][VM1P0]:** I think this was the newer one, despite its
  hard copy having an earlier printing date. Supports both single-player and
  multiplayer, as well as an additional floppy disk save location for the last
  score achieved.

This code is provided in its original formatting. There are no instructions for
how to compile this in a modern IDE, if you can even do so without
modification. Since I wrote this back when I was a beginner, expect to find
many style issues, code smells, and possible bugs. None of those problems will
be fixed since this is being preserved as a personal historical artifact.

As a hobby project, I decided to reimplement this game using more modern
technologies and design patterns, with some additional enhancements, as a way
of showing how far I have come since then. You can find that GitHub repository
